## Sorting Recycling Machine
 This project consists of a machine that uses computer vision with machine learning to identify recycling objects like bottles and cans and sort them. The objects are placed on a platform that the camera will scan and make a decision on the type of object to place in different bins. After the classification is made, an arm will push the object off the platform and down the ramp. On the ramp, there are 2 arms that will move in accordance to the type of object that was identified. The arms will allow the object to fall into its intended container.
